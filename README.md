# accessibility-worksheet

<h2>A simple accessiblity website </h2>

<p> It is purposely poorly developed to expose multiple common accessibility problems we run into. </p>

<p> There are a number of accessibility problems that will be found using automated checkers. However, there are a lot of common issues that do not get picked up by automated checkers and need to be manually assessed to determine if they are WCAG violations or not. </p>

<p> Take a look through the website and see how many errors you can find!</p>
